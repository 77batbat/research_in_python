# Doing Quantitative Research In Python
In the Spring of 2015, I committed to carrying out my general exams in a way that made a contribution to public knowledge. I'm summarizing every book and article I read on AcaWiki ([the full list is here](http://acawiki.org/J_Nathan_Matias_General_Exams_Reading_List)).

This repository on Github includes all the data analyses I carry out in the quantitative section on "[Statistical Methods for Computational Social Science](http://acawiki.org/J_Nathan_Matias_General_Exams_Reading_List#Statistical_Methods_for_Computational_Social_Science)."
